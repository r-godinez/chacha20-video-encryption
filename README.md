# chacha20-video-encryption
This project implements a real-time video encryption system using the ChaCha20 stream cipher. The system captures video from a webcam on a Raspberry Pi, encrypts each frame using ChaCha20 encryption, and transmits the encrypted data over a network to a receiving computer for decryption and display.
